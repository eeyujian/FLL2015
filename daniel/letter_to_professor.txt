Dear,Professor

        My name is Daniel.We are doing FLL (first lego league ) project. This year FLL  is based on trash ,recycle , and compost. FLL requires a professional suggestion on waste for each team .We found you on the PSU webpage.We believe you are an outstanding professor and researcher on waste.

        Can we go to your office to talk about our project for 30 minutes? We can come after 4:30 pm on any week day.

Best regards
Daniel Xian
